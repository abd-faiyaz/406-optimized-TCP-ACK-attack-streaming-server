Starting the Server:
Running an Attack:
Monitoring Dashboard:
Normal TCP Flow Control:
Client sends data to server
Server sends ACK confirming receipt
Server uses ACK number to determine what data to send next
Flow control prevents overwhelming the receiver
Optimistic ACK Attack:
Attacker connects to server normally
Fake ACK injection - Attacker sends ACK packets claiming to have received more data than actually sent
Server acceleration - Server believes client received more data, sends faster
Data amplification - Attacker gets significantly faster transfer rates
